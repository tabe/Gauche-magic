Basic
=====

It is necessary to:
- use gauche 0.8.7 or later
- have been installed the magic library (aka libmagic) of file-4.12 or higher.


Command lines
=============

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install


Distribution Specific
=====================

* Debian (etch)
If you do not have the magic library, then:
# aptitude install libmagic1 libmagic-dev

* Fedora 8
If you do not have the magic library, then:
# yum install file

* FreeBSD 6.2
If you do not have the magic library, then:
# cd /usr/ports/sysutils/file
# make install clean

* Cygwin
I have succeeded in installing it with Cygwin DLL 1.5.21-1 (Windows XP).
Good luck! :-)
