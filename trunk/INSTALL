Basic
=====

It is necessary to:
- use gauche 0.8.7 or later
- have been installed the magic library (aka libmagic) of file-4.12 or higher.


Command lines
=============

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install


Distribution Specific
=====================

* Debian (sarge)
If you do not have the magic library, then:
# apt-get install libmagic1 libmagic-dev

* Fedora Core 5
If you do not have the magic library, then:
# yum install file

* Cygwin
I have succeeded in installing it with Cygwin DLL 1.5.21-1 (Windows XP).
Good luck! :-)
